# 28 Days of Flutter Challenge
This is my repository for the 28 Days of Flutter challenge, where I'll be learning and practicing Flutter by building a new app every day for 28 days. 

## Day 1: [Restaurant Picker](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day01_restaurant_picker)
This is a Flutter app that randomly selects a restaurant from a list of restaurants, when the user presses the "Pick Restaurant" button.

## Day 2:[Tip Calculator](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day02_tip_calculator)
This is a Flutter app that calculates a tip based on a user-entered total amount and a selected tip percentage. The app has a simple user interface with a text field for entering the total amount, a set of toggle buttons for selecting the tip percentage, and a button for calculating the tip

## Day 3:[Easy Read](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day03_easy_read)
This is a simple Flutter app with a text field and a slider. The app allows the user to change the font size of the text in the text field using the slider.
