# 28 Days of Flutter Challenge

This is my repository for the 28 Days of Flutter challenge, where I'll be learning and practicing Flutter by building a new app every day for 28 days. 

## Day 1: [Restaurant Picker](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day01_restaurant_picker)

### Concepts Learned
- MaterialApp and Scaffold widgets
- Text and ELevated button widgets
- MaterialStateProperty Color

## Dat 2:[Tip Calculator]()

This is a Flutter app that calculates a tip based on a user-entered total amount and a selected tip percentage. The app has a simple user interface with a text field for entering the total amount, a set of toggle buttons for selecting the tip percentage, and a button for calculating the tip
