# 28 Days of Flutter Challenge
This is my repository for the 28 Days of Flutter challenge, where I'll be learning and practicing Flutter by building a new app every day for 28 days. 

## Day 1: [Restaurant Picker](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day01_restaurant_picker)
This is a Flutter app that randomly selects a restaurant from a list of restaurants, when the user presses the "Pick Restaurant" button.

## Day 2:[Tip Calculator](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day02_tip_calculator)
This is a Flutter app that calculates a tip based on a user-entered total amount and a selected tip percentage. The app has a simple user interface with a text field for entering the total amount, a set of toggle buttons for selecting the tip percentage, and a button for calculating the tip

## Day 3:[Easy Read](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day03_easy_read)
This is a simple Flutter app with a text field and a slider. The app allows the user to change the font size of the text in the text field using the slider.

## Day 4:[Flashcard App](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day04_flashcards) 
This is a Flutter application that displays flashcards with questions and answers, and allows the user to navigate through them using the "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons.
## Day 5:[Web View](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day05_show_webview)
This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use a web view widget to display a webpage inside a Flutter app.
## Day 6:[Picture Carousel](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day06_picture_carousel)
This is a Flutter application that creates a picture carousel using the carousel_slider package.
## Day 7:[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day07_tic_tac_toe)
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player  game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking their chosen symbol (traditionally X or O) in an empty square of the grid, with the aim of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends either when a player achieves a winning pattern or when all squares are filled, resulting in a draw. Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that is often used as an educational tool for teaching basic concepts of game theory and artificial intelligence.

## Day 8:[Save data to shared preferences](https://github.com/safadtm/28DaysOfFlutter/tree/master/day08_user_settings)
This is a Flutter application that allows the user to select their preferred settings and save them to persistent storage using the PreferencesService class. The UI consists of a ListView with various form elements such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches, allowing the user to select their preferred options.
